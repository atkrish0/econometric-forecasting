### Abstract:
Inflation can be defined as the loss of purchasing power of a fiat currency over a defined period of time. It plays a key role in designing the macroeconomic policy of central banks across the world. During periods of high growth rates, the inflation rate generally rises; deflation occurs during periods of low or negative growth rates. 

Inflation forecasts are the bedrock of a sovereign nationâ€™s approach to monetary and fiscal policy, hence a grasp of the level of dependability of the predictions is imperative for crafting policy and legislation.

Price stability has been found to be one of the critical aims of the central banks of the emerging market by the Bank for International Settlements. In most market economies, the validity of macroeconomic forecasts is hindered by the absence of accurate data, both in time series and cross-sectional formats. Given this limitation, this research uses a host of machine learning methods to generate optimal features and check if they can offer any improvements in prediction accuracy for headline Consumer Price Index inflation in the United States according to monthly Federal Reserve Economic Data.

This study compares three different Vector Autoregression models (VAR) in their in-sample forecasting. Optimal feature selection is performed using machine learning methods in some of these models. In contrast, one of the VAR models relies on a traditional technique of just choosing relevant variables based on classical economic literature. This study aims to understand how feature selection from the Lasso regression and the XGBoost algorithm can improve the forecasting accuracy of vector autoregressive models (VAR).
